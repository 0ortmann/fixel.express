## Gopher Graphics

The gopher graphics are taken from [https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-vector](https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-vector), all credits to the respective creators. Orignally the gopher was designed by Renee French [http://reneefrench.blogspot.de](http://reneefrench.blogspot.de). She gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rw_B4yY69k) at this years Gophercon about the gopher-history, which inspired me to use them on my website. The graphics reside in `public/img`. I did slight modifications in color, size and arm movement and added little hammers. The gopher graphics are licensed under the Creative Commons 3.0 Attributions license.
