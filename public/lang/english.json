      "I like designing and implementing distributed systems and constantly look for challenges. Working on Linux servers is my favorite, a shell is everything I want. I love to learn new stuff and long for new intellectual input.",
      "Currently I'm studying msc. at the University of Hamburg, Germany. I do software development since 2011; back then, things started with a distributed simulator for higher level Petri nets. For a living I do fullstack development, mostly web stuff (the backend parts) and devops.",
      "I love being on the move in the nature, either with backpack & tent or I go fishing on local lakes and rivers.",
      "I do a lot of fun coding as well, make sure to check out my github page!"
